# Data: Design Matrix

- Columns are features
- Target values are sometimes in a separate vector, sometimes in the final index on the matrix
  - Unsupervised learning doesn't have the target column
- Columns can be computed
  - You can add columns with statistical measures like a mean or median
  - Binary (yes/no) flags as features are possible too
  - Ratios are also possible
- Rows are entire things (a car, a flower, etc)

# Exploratory Data Analysis

- Relationships between features
- Outlier detection
- Find irrelevant features
- Get stats about the data as a whole
- Duplicate data
- Balanced data set (though we can't determine whether it is balanced without more datasets)
- Find the distribution of the features
- For each feature, do: mean, median, mode, counts, stddev, percentiles
  - Categorical values: counts, % missing, # of unique values
- Missing values: drop them, interpolate, set a flag for the data's presence
- Normalization: (x, y) -> (x', y')
- Standardization: best used on normal data
