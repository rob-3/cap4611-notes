# What is Machine Learning?

- A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P if the its performance on T as measured by P improves with experience E
  - Eg spam classification: emails = spam | not spam
    - T == identify spam
    - P == % of spam identified correctly
    - E == lots of examples of emails

# Old way of solving ML type problems

- Study problem -> try to figure out rules -> write code to use rules -> evaluate
  - Difficult and expensive

# Machine Learning

- Now we train a machine learning algorithm
  - Then, the machine can figure out the rules with much better granularity than we can
- Data -> training -> evaluation -> launch -> update data -> eval -> ...
  - Easily automatable
  - However, bad data can lead to bad results

# How to do ML

1. Study the problem
1. Identify/gather data
1. Explore and analyze the data
1. Prepare data
   - Address missing values
   - Normalize
   - Clean up
   - Handle outliers
   - etc
1. Select the model and train

> **No free lunch theorem**: there's no way to know which model to use unless you understand the problem

1. Validate
1. Launch and monitor
