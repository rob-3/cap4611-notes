# How to Read the Book

> Don't read cover to cover

1. Skim the chapter: this should give a reasonable idea of what it is about
1. Go back and read until the first code/formula/diagram: you can check if you understand by seeing if you recreating it yourself
   - Use a Jupyter notebook
1. Repeat step 2

Two main types of learning: supervised and unsupervised

# Supervised Learning

We have a dataset composed of many columns of `x` and a single `y` column

A column is a feature; and

`x` is a feature vector (containing values for each feature) and often represents a single entity.
`y` is a target and the label

Ex: For (weight, height, bmi), weight and height are x and bmi is y

We build a model that can take a feature vector and produce a prediction for the target.

> This process of extending our data to provide a prediction is **generalization**

2 main uses:

- Classification: dealing with categorical data
  - Can be binary (is an email spam?)
  - Multiclass (what shape do I have?)
- Regression: predict a real value
  - Ex: height, weight -> bmi

# Unsupervised Learning

Similar to supervised learning, but there are no labels.

- We can't use this to make predictions
- We **can** use this to make associates within the data
  - Ex: Is there an association between people who buy diapers and beer?
  - Ex: Are there clusters that we can use to reduce dimensionality?
  - Ex: Anomaly detection

# Reinforcement Learning

Learning through experience: you put an agent into an environment and reward or
punish it depending on what it does. Over time, it will learn to take the
"right" actions

# Instance-Based Learning

# Model-Based Learning

Use an equation to predict

# Batch Learning

Feed all the data into the model in one shot.

# Online Learning

We can put in one piece at a time. This is nice because we can upgrade the model while it is live. However, it's more easily corruptible if bad data is given.

# Semi-Supervised Learning

Some labeled data, but not everything is labeled.

Ex: image labeling - we may have millions of images, but only some portion are labeled

# Problems with ML

- Lack of data
- Unrepresentative data
- Poor quality data: if the data isn't related to the target, ML can't fix this
